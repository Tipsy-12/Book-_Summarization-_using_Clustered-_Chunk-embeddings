#  ðŸ“š Semantic Clustering-Based Summarisation of Long Books

1. Load your book into a single text file
2. Split your text into large-ish chunks
3. Embed your chunks to get vectors
4. Cluster the vectors to see which are similar to each other and likely talk about the same parts of the book
5. Pick embeddings that represent the cluster the most (method: closest to each cluster centroid)
6. Summarise the documents that these embeddings represent

Itâ€™s particularly effective for books too long to fit into a single LLM context window.

### ðŸ§  Conclusions

- Our LLM-generated summary aligns closely with detailed, human-style references, achieving a **cosine similarity of 0.83**.
- Traditional lexical metrics (ROUGE, BLEU, etc.) **underestimate semantic match** when comparing summaries with differing granularity or phrasing because they rely on surface-level word overlap.
- **Embedding-based evaluation (Cosine Similarity)** provides a more reliable assessment of summary quality in long-document tasks.
- Our summary shows significantly stronger alignment with an **AI-generated reference** than with a brief Wikipedia-style summary.

### Summary of the book Animal Farm generated by this approach:

Animal Farm is an allegorical novella that tells the story of a group of farm animals who rebel against their human farmer, Mr. Jones, in the hopes of creating a society based on equality and freedom. Led by the pigs, Napoleon and Snowball, the animals successfully overthrow Jones and establish Animal Farm, governed by the Seven Commandments of Animalism. However, a power struggle emerges between Napoleon and Snowball, culminating in Snowball's expulsion and Napoleon's rise to dictatorial power. Under Napoleon's rule, the pigs gradually betray the original ideals of the Rebellion, exploiting the other animals for their own gain. They rewrite history, manipulate the commandments, and use propaganda and terror to maintain control. The farm's windmill, initially envisioned as a symbol of progress, becomes a source of hardship and exploitation. The loyal and hardworking Boxer is eventually sent to the glue factory when he is no longer useful. As the years pass, the pigs become increasingly human-like, adopting human habits and engaging in trade with neighbouring farmers. In the end, the pigs have become indistinguishable from the humans they once overthrew, and the animals are left in a state of oppression and disillusionment, unable to tell the difference between pig and man.

As Harry navigates the challenges of the tournament, including battling a dragon, rescuing Ron from the Black Lake, and navigating a treacherous maze, he uncovers a sinister plot orchestrated by Lord Voldemort. Barty Crouch Jr., disguised as Professor Moody, has manipulated the tournament to ensure Harry's victory and transport him to Voldemort. In a graveyard, Voldemort, having regained a rudimentary body, uses Harry's blood in a dark ritual to restore his full power. He then duels Harry, revealing his plan to return to power and his past encounters with Harry. The book culminates in a tragic showdown where Cedric Diggory is murdered, and Harry barely escapes with his life, carrying the horrifying truth of Voldemort's return to the wizarding world.
