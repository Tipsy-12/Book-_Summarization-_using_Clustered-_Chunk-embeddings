#  ðŸ“š Semantic Clustering-Based Summarisation of Long Books

1. Load your book into a single text file
2. Split your text into large-ish chunks
3. Embed your chunks to get vectors
4. Cluster the vectors to see which are similar to each other and likely talk about the same parts of the book
5. Pick embeddings that represent the cluster the most (method: closest to each cluster centroid)
6. Summarise the documents that these embeddings represent

Itâ€™s particularly effective for books too long to fit into a single LLM context window.

### ðŸ§  Conclusions

- Our LLM-generated summary aligns closely with detailed, human-style references, achieving a **cosine similarity of 0.83**.
- Traditional lexical metrics (ROUGE, BLEU, etc.) **underestimate semantic match** because they rely on surface-level word overlap.
- **Embedding-based evaluation (Cosine Similarity)** provides a more reliable assessment of summary quality in long-document tasks.
- Our summary shows significantly stronger alignment with an **AI-generated reference** than with a brief Wikipedia-style summary.

### Summary of the book Animal Farm generated by this approach:

Animal Farm is an allegorical novella that tells the story of a group of farm animals who rebel against their human farmer, Mr. Jones, in the hopes of creating a society based on equality and freedom. Led by the pigs, Napoleon and Snowball, the animals successfully overthrow Jones and establish Animal Farm, governed by the Seven Commandments of Animalism. However, a power struggle emerges between Napoleon and Snowball, culminating in Snowball's expulsion and Napoleon's rise to dictatorial power. Under Napoleon's rule, the pigs gradually betray the original ideals of the Rebellion, exploiting the other animals for their own gain. They rewrite history, manipulate the commandments, and use propaganda and terror to maintain control. The farm's windmill, initially envisioned as a symbol of progress, becomes a source of hardship and exploitation. The loyal and hardworking Boxer is eventually sent to the glue factory when he is no longer useful. As the years pass, the pigs become increasingly human-like, adopting human habits and engaging in trade with neighbouring farmers. In the end, the pigs have become indistinguishable from the humans they once overthrew, and the animals are left in a state of oppression and disillusionment, unable to tell the difference between pig and man.

### Summary of the book The Fountainhead (523 pages)

"The Fountainhead" by Ayn Rand explores the themes of individualism versus collectivism through the life and career of architect Howard Roark, who refuses to compromise his artistic vision. The story begins with Roark's expulsion from architecture school due to his unconventional designs. He then works for various firms, including Francon & Heyer, where he encounters Peter Keating, a talented but insecure architect who prioritises popularity over integrity. Keating's ambition leads him to seek Roark's help secretly while publicly undermining him. Roark also meets Dominique Francon, a complex and cynical woman who is drawn to his uncompromising nature but attempts to destroy him to protect herself from the world's mediocrity. Their relationship is marked by intense passion and a destructive dynamic.

As Keating's career declines due to his lack of originality, Roark continues to face challenges, including the rejection of his designs and the struggle to find clients who appreciate his vision. He works in a granite quarry to maintain his independence. Meanwhile, Keating's desperation leads him to secure the commission for Cortlandt Homes, a large-scale housing project, which he designs based on Roark's principles, albeit poorly executed. When the project is compromised by committee decisions and fails to meet his standards, Roark dynamites the building.

Roark's act of defiance leads to a highly publicised trial, during which he defends his actions and articulates his philosophy of individualism. Gail Wynand, a powerful newspaper publisher who is married to Dominique, initially attempts to manipulate public opinion in Roark's favour but ultimately fails and destroys his career and reputation in the process. Roark is eventually acquitted, and the novel concludes with him designing the Wynand Building, a testament to his unwavering commitment to his principles, with Dominique by his side, finally accepting his vision.
