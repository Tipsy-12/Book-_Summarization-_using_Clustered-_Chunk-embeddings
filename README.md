#  ðŸ“š Semantic Clustering-Based Summarisation of Long Books

1. Load your book into a single text file
2. Split your text into large-ish chunks
3. Embed your chunks to get vectors
4. Cluster the vectors to see which are similar to each other and likely talk about the same parts of the book
5. Pick embeddings that represent the cluster the most (method: closest to each cluster centroid)
6. Summarise the documents that these embeddings represent

Itâ€™s particularly effective for books too long to fit into a single LLM context window.

### ðŸ§  Conclusions

- Our LLM-generated summary aligns closely with detailed, human-style references, achieving a **cosine similarity of 0.83**.
- Traditional lexical metrics (ROUGE, BLEU, etc.) **underestimate semantic match** when comparing summaries with differing granularity or phrasing because they rely on surface-level word overlap.
- **Embedding-based evaluation (Cosine Similarity)** provides a more reliable assessment of summary quality in long-document tasks.
- Our summary shows significantly stronger alignment with an **AI-generated reference** than with a brief Wikipedia-style summary.

### Summary of the book Animal Farm generated by this approach:

Animal Farm, by George Orwell, is an allegorical novella that uses a farm animal rebellion to satirize the Russian Revolution and the subsequent Stalinist era. The story begins with Old Major, a prize-winning boar, inspiring the animals of Manor Farm with a vision of a society free from human tyranny, where all animals are equal. He teaches them the song "Beasts of England" and the principles of Animalism.

After Old Major's death, the animals, led by the intelligent pigs Snowball and Napoleon, successfully revolt against the cruel and neglectful farmer, Mr. Jones. They rename the farm "Animal Farm" and establish the Seven Commandments of Animalism, the most important of which is "All animals are equal." Initially, the animals experience a period of unprecedented freedom and prosperity. They work together to harvest the crops, and the pigs, being the most intelligent, take on leadership roles.

However, tensions soon arise between Snowball and Napoleon. Snowball is a charismatic and idealistic leader who advocates for technological advancements, such as building a windmill to generate electricity. Napoleon, on the other hand, is a more cunning and power-hungry pig who prioritizes control. Through manipulation and the use of his trained guard dogs, Napoleon drives Snowball off the farm and establishes himself as the supreme leader.

Under Napoleon's rule, Animal Farm gradually transforms into a totalitarian regime. The pigs systematically rewrite history, distorting the truth to maintain their power and control. Squealer, Napoleon's propagandist, uses eloquent rhetoric and deceptive tactics to convince the other animals that the pigs' actions are always in their best interests. The Seven Commandments are subtly altered to justify the pigs' growing privileges and abuses of power. For example, "No animal shall drink alcohol" becomes "No animal shall drink alcohol to excess."

The animals work tirelessly, driven by the promise of a better future and the fear of Mr. Jones's return. Boxer, a loyal and hardworking cart-horse, embodies the exploited working class, blindly devoted to Napoleon and the farm. He adopts the motto "I will work harder" and "Napoleon is always right," pushing himself to exhaustion. The windmill, initially Snowball's idea, becomes a symbol of the animals' labor and the pigs' ambition. After the windmill is destroyed in a storm, Napoleon blames Snowball, using him as a scapegoat to consolidate his power and instill fear among the animals.

As the pigs consolidate their power, they begin to adopt human habits, such as sleeping in beds, drinking alcohol, and engaging in trade with neighboring farmers. The other animals, particularly Clover, become increasingly disillusioned as they witness the pigs' betrayal of the original principles of Animalism. However, they are either too afraid or too ignorant to challenge Napoleon's authority.

The pigs' exploitation of the other animals reaches its peak when Boxer collapses from exhaustion. Instead of receiving proper medical care, he is sold to a glue factory, and the pigs use the money to buy more whisky. Squealer deceives the animals into believing that Boxer died peacefully in a hospital, reaffirming his loyalty to Animal Farm.

Years pass, and the original animals who remembered the Rebellion dwindle. The pigs become indistinguishable from the humans they once overthrew. In the final scene, the other animals watch through a window as the pigs play cards with neighboring farmers. They can no longer tell the difference between the pigs and the humans, symbolizing the complete corruption of the revolution and the establishment of a new form of tyranny, even more oppressive than the old. The pigs have become the very thing they fought against, demonstrating the cyclical nature of power and the dangers of unchecked authority.
